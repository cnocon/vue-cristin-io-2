<p className="drop-cap">We will always be learning new things as our field evolves over time, so I wanted to list out my favorite online learning platforms for front end engineers (at various levels). While none of the below services are free, they are well worth the investment because a subscription is an investment in yourself and your own earning power.</p>
<p>Each has its own particular strength, which I've called out below: </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Best Mid and Advanced Level Content<br/><img style="display: block; max-width: 320px; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.pluralsight.com/content/pluralsight/en/newsroom/brand-assets/jcr:content/main/generic_block/parsys/columns_108996112/column-parsys-1/flex_block/parsys/flex_card_copy_copy_222784545/image-res.img.568d2540-2732-471d-ada5-c062bc76a70a.jpg" alt="Pluralsight Logo" /></h3>
<p>Pluralsight tends to have instructors that will dive into more advanced content during lectures, which is great if you've been around the blocks a few times. Course transcripts and the ability to adjust video playback speed make this a decent platform to invest in for professional development.</p>
